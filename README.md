# Demonstrations for Palestine

## Adding more data
Help add new sources — that you might come across at anytime — to the public dataset: [`dataset/demonstrations-for-palestine.csv`](dataset/demonstrations-for-palestine.csv).

Once you've created a GitHub account (perhaps a throwaway), click the edit button in the file, continue to the file and add your new source(s). You'll then be prompted to create a "pull request" upon which your changes will be submitted for review.

Make sure the data (event's date and location) you're adding doesn't already exist in the dataset; further, duplicate work can also be avoided by checking if someone else has already proposed the same changes.

> We'll add a form to make this easier for non-technical users.
